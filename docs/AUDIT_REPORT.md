## 🔧 Recommendations

1. **Atomic Design Compliance**: Review pages with high direct HTML usage and refactor to use atomic components.
2. **Remove Orphaned Components**: Delete unused components to reduce codebase complexity.
3. **Refactor Large Files**: Consider breaking down files over 400 lines into smaller, more manageable components.
4. **Internationalization**: Move hardcoded strings to localization files for better maintainability.
